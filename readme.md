# Spider web

## Architecture Change Reason

Before the web version, the desktop version had several issues:

- **Version Updates:** Updating the version was not easy. Users needed to download and install the new version manually.
- **Error Logs:** Retrieving error logs was cumbersome. Users had to send the log files to us.
- **Network Issues:** The spider required an overseas network to fetch data. Some users had unstable networks, so we switched to using an overseas server to get the data.

Based on these issues, we decided to build a web version to provide the service.
